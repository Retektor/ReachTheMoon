# ReachTheMoon
A repository for little web idle-game made as personal non-commercial project.
Any ideas/playtesting/opinion are hugely welcome and possibly can contribute for improving the game.

This game is in Russian language, but in case it gets popularity in the English-speaking community, it can get official English translation.

This projects is being contributed by one person, but you may still distribute my work under the MIT license.
